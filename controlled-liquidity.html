  <h1>What is Controlled Liquidity?</h1>

  <p>
    Controlled liquidity is a capital access model where withdrawals are structured over time,
    instead of allowing instant full exits.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many capital systems fail because liquidity is unmanaged.
    When participants are able to exit fully and instantly, systems face instability and collapse.
  </p>

  <h2>Why liquidity structure matters</h2>

  <p>
    Controlled liquidity introduces predefined withdrawal rules.
    Participants retain access to their capital, but liquidity is released progressively.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach protects system stability while preserving participant control.
  </p>

  <h2>Progressive withdrawals</h2>

  <p>
    Progressive withdrawals allow participants to withdraw a growing portion of their capital over time.
    Early exits are limited, while long-term participants gain increased access.
  </p>

  <p>
    This model aligns incentives between participants and the system.
  </p>

  <h2>How Capexa applies controlled liquidity</h2>

  <p>
    Capexa applies controlled liquidity through progressive withdrawal rules.
    Withdrawal allowances increase over time under transparent conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Early access participation may include additional rules such as cooling-off periods
    and processing fees, disclosed before deposit confirmation.
