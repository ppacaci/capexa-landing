  <h1>What are Progressive Withdrawals?</h1>

  <p>
    Progressive withdrawals are a structured capital access model where withdrawal limits
    increase over time instead of allowing instant full access.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach prevents sudden liquidity shocks while ensuring participants
    gradually regain full access to their capital.
  </p>

  <h2>Why instant withdrawals break systems</h2>

  <p>
    Many capital systems fail when all participants are able to exit at once.
    Instant withdrawals create liquidity stress and destabilize operations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Progressive withdrawals reduce this risk by aligning withdrawal access with time.
  </p>

  <h2>How progressive access works</h2>

  <p>
    Under a progressive withdrawal model, participants can withdraw a limited portion
    of their capital early on.
  </p>

  <p>
    As time passes, withdrawal allowances increase according to predefined rules.
    Long-term participants gain broader access.
  </p>
